Ruchi Hegde (ruh32@pitt.edu) - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/smart-trash-containers: This dataset shows the different smart trash containers in neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. It connects to our metric of environmentally safe because the more smart trash containers, the more organized trash collection. With a smart trash cans, trash trucks are able to come only when the bins are actually full, which reduces air pollution. The neighborhood with the most trash cans to area ratio is the most environmentally friendly.

Dailynn Tejeda (djt60@pitt.edu) - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-beautify-the-burgh: This dataset displays various clean-up crews that were assigned to different Pittsburgh neighborhoods. Additionally, the dataset shows the amount of acreage that each crew covered. This connects to our metric of environmental friendliness because the larger of acreage that was cleaned , the cleaner the neighborhood is. Thus, the more environmentally friendly the neighborhood is.

Le Lin (lel112@pitt.edu) - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh: The fire-incidents in pittsburgh contains all the fire-cases of different neighborhoods in pittsburgh. The fire incidents effect the air quality and air pollution. The places where less fire incidents will have better air quality. So the fire-incidents dataset is also related to the environmental friendness. Base on my individual metric, I use the ratio acres/frequency, so where the ratio is higher, the less fire incidents happened. In contrast if using the ratio of frequency/acre, the neighborhood that has lowest ratio will be the best.

# What is the best neighborhood? And How did you determine that answer (brief summary of metrics): 

According to our metric in finding the most environmentally friendly neighborhood, we found that Mount Washington is the best neighborhood because it has the largest total ratio and Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar is the lowest neighborhood with the least ratio. The total ratio is the ratio of smart trash cans/acre added to the sum of cleaned land/acre minus the fire incidents/acre. Each personal notebook came up with a ratio, for both Beautify the Burgh and the Smart Trash Containers the higher the ratio the better the neighborhood. Differently, the ratio for fire incidents is inverse, so the lower the ratio, the better. For example, if the ratio of the number of smart trash cans to acres of neighborhood is higher, that means that there are more trash cans per acre, which means it is a more environmentally friendly neighborhood. Additionally, if the last ratio of acres cleaned up in a neighborhood to the acres of the whole neighborhood is higher, that means that the neighborhood is more clean. However, if the ratio of the amount of fires to the acreage of the neighborhood is low that means that there are less fires per acre, which is better. Mount Washington had the highest total ratio of all three of those ratios combined, which means that it is the most environmentally friendly neighborhood. Our three datasets were fire incidents, smart trash containers, and beautifying the burgh. When combined, our metric evenly weighs those three separate metrics to form one value, which is our total ratio. Our datasets did contain some NaN and inf values after diving to get the ratio, and to address that, we just set them equal to 0, to have no effect on the total ratio. The total ratio value is what we used to determine which neighborhood is the most environmentally friendly.
