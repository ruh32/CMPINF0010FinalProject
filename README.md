Ruchi Hegde (ruh32@pitt.edu) - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/smart-trash-containers: This dataset shows the different smart trash containers in neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. It connects to our metric of environmentally safe because the more smart trash containers, the more organized trash collection. With a smart trash cans, trash trucks are able to come only when the bins are actually full, which reduces air pollution.
