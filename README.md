Ruchi Hegde (ruh32@pitt.edu) - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/smart-trash-containers: This dataset shows the different smart trash containers in neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. It connects to our metric of environmentally safe because the more smart trash containers, the more organized trash collection. With a smart trash cans, trash trucks are able to come only when the bins are actually full, which reduces air pollution. The neighborhood with the most trash cans to area ratio is the most environmentally friendly.

Dailynn Tejeda (djt60@pitt.edu) - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-beautify-the-burgh: This dataset shows the number of orgaizations that participate in cleaning as part of Beautify the Burgh in different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. This connects to our metric of environmental friendliness because the more cleaning organizations, the more clean neighborhoods are in Pittsburgh.

Le Lin (lel112@pitt.edu) - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh: This dataset shows the different fire incidents that took place in neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. This connects to environmental safety because fire releases smoke which is air pollution, so the neighborhood with the fewest incidents to area ratio is the most environmentally safe.

## What is the best neighborhood? And How did you determine that answer (brief summary of metrics): 
According to our metric in finding the most environmentally friendly neighborhood, we found that Hays is the best neighborhood because it has the largest total ratio and Perry North is the lowest neighborhood with the least ratio. The total ratio is the sum of our three individual ratio totals. Each personal notebook came up with a ratio, such that the higher the ratio the better the neighborhood. For example, if the ratio of the acres of neighborhood to the amount of fires is large that means that there are less fires per acre. Similarly, if the ratio of the number of smart trash cans to acres of neighborhood is higher, that means that there are more trash cans per acre, which means it is a more environmentally friendly neighborhood. Additionally, if the last ratio of acres cleaned up in a neighborhood to the acres of the whole neighborhood is higher, that means that the neighborhood is more clean. Hayes had the highest total ratio of all three of those ratios added together, which means that it is the most environmentally friendly neighborhood. Our three datasets were fire incidents, smart trash containers, and beautifying the burgh. When combined, our metric evenly weighs those three separate metrics to form one value, which is our total ratio. The beautifying the burgh dataset did contain some NaN values, and to address that, we just set them equal to 0, to have no effect on the total ratio. The total ratio value is what we used to determine which neighborhood is the most environmentally friendly.
